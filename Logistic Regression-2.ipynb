    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans:-Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning to search for the optimal hyperparameters of a model from a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. The purpose of Grid Search CV is to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning and find the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best model performance.\r\n",

    "Split the training data into k folds (usually 5 or 10). For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, train the model on k-1 folds and validate it on the remaining fold. Repeat this process for each fold, and calculate the average performance metric across all folds.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "1. Separate Training and Testing Datasets:\r\n",
    "Practice:\r\n",
    "Split the dataset into separate training and testing sets.\r\n",

    "Practice:\r\n",
    "For time series data, use temporal splits for training and testing, ensuring that future information is not used for predictions.\r\n",
    "Reason:\r\n",
    "Time-dependent relationships in the data may cause leakage if not handled properly.\r\n",
    "4. Avoid Using Future Information:\r\n",
    "Practice:\r\n",
    "Ensure that features used for prediction are available at the time of prediction and do not include future information.\r\n",
